abstract="Whitebox fuzzing (a.k.a. concolic testing) has been shown to be an effective bug finding technique on its own as well as in combination with coverage-guided greybox fuzzing. However, there is currently a lack of whitebox fuzzers operating above the binary code level. We present KLUZZER, a whitebox fuzzer targeting LLVM bitcode, and thus can be easily combined with the widely deployed LLVM's coverage-guided greybox fuzzer LibFuzzer. Experimental evaluation on a set of benchmarks shows encouraging results.",
